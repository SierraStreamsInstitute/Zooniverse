REM NOTE: This was written for use on a Windows computer
REM All sections that start with "REM" are comments/remarks. Do not delete "REM"
REM that has python v 3.9, pip, and panoptes client installed. 
REM For more info see "README" in the Zooniverse GitHub folder

REM All photos must be saved in one target folder location
REM We must then create a .csv file that lists all files names that match the photos
REM This script will automatically create that .csv, upload it, and upload the associated photos

REM Change "[FOLDER]" to your photo folder location (full path including C:\)

REM Launch your command prompt by clicking start, typing "CMD", then right clicking on command prompt and selecting "Run as administrator"
REM Click "yes" on the prompt

REM At the command line, copy and paste all of the code below up until the next comment, then press enter

cd\ [FOLDER]
dir > DCWildlifeManifest.csv

REM After creating the .csv, navigate to the folder you made it in, and open it
REM delete the excess data (date column) and excess rows (any rows that don't have photo names)
REM This includes 2 extra metadata rows at the end of the file list
REM Insert a row above the remaining data and name the first column "raw"
REM Label the second column "image"
REM in the second column, first cell, type =right(A2,len(A2)-4) and hit enter
REM the cell should now have the shortened file name (just 3 letters, a few numbers, and .jpg)
REM double click the bottom right corner of the cell to extend this to the bottom of the data sheet
